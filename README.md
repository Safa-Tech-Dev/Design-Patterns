# SOLID PRINCIPLES
## (S) -> Single Responsibility Principle
* A Class should have only one reason to change.
* Focused **single Responsibility** addresses a specific concern.
* If you can’t describe what a class does in one clear sentence without using "and", it’s probably doing too much.

## (O) -> Open Closed Principle
* A class, module, or function should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Open for extension → You should be able to add new functionality.
* Closed for modification → You should NOT change the existing code whenever a new requirement comes.

## (D) -> Dependency Inversion Principle
* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
* Both should depend on abstractions.
* Abstractions should not depend on details.
* Details should depend on abstractions.

- In simple terms: 
If high-level logic directly depends on low-level implementations, changes in the low-level code can break the high-level logic.

- In more simple terms:
Class should depend on interface rather than concrete class.
