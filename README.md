# SOLID PRINCIPLES

## (D) -> Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details.
Details should depend on abstractions.

in simple terms
If high-level logic directly depends on low-level implementations, changes in the low-level code can break the high-level logic.

in more simple terms
Class should depend on interface rather than concrete class.
